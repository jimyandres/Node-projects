# Node Web Crawler

This is a script that allows you to download the html of a given URL webpage.

Additionally, a new folder will be created and will have these two files: `url.txt`  and `file.html`.

In `url.txt`, as you might guess, it contains the URL site from where the `file.html` was downloaded.

## HOW TO RUN

To run the script use the following:

```
$ node download.js <URL>
```
**Note:** if the ``URL`` argument is optional, the default URL is set to `https://www.npmjs.com/`
