# CSV to JSON Converter

This is the Module 1 - assignment lab, which is about build a script that can convert a CSV file into an JSON. To achieve that, it was used the `csvtojson` module.

## CONTEXT OF THE PROBLEM

*Imagine you work at a Bitcoin exchange and you have customer information coming from another source: SSN, credit card and their bitcoin numbers. However, the file format is CSV and your exchange can only support JSON.*

## HOW TO RUN

To run the script use the following instruction:

```
$ node CSVtoJSON.js <csv_file>
```

**Notes:**

* To run the example provided (in the `example/` folder), run the same command without the `csv_file` option.

* The converted file will be saved (if it works correctly) at the same level of the provided `csv_file` location and with the same base name.
